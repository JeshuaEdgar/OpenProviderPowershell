# OpenProviderPowershell

## ! In development !
This module/wrapper is and will be in development (until most OpenProvider API endpoints are covered), I will try and cover as many endpoints as possible starting with basic domain and DNS management. 

## To-do:
Get-OPZone
Get-OPZoneRecord
Add-OPZoneRecord
Add-OPZone

# What works:
[Connect-OpenProvider](https://github.com/JeshuaEdgar/OpenProviderPowershell/blob/master/Public/func_Connect-OpenProvider.ps1)
[Disconnect-OpenProvider](https://github.com/JeshuaEdgar/OpenProviderPowershell/blob/master/Public/func_Disconnect-OpenProvider.ps1)
[Get-OPDomain](https://github.com/JeshuaEdgar/OpenProviderPowershell/blob/master/Public/func_Get-OPDomain.ps1)
